Bluebird tracks users on X (formerly Twitter) and sends post notifications to Discord.

## Features

-   Monitor any public user on X â€” no login required (thanks to [dylanpdx/BetterTwitFix](https://github.com/dylanpdx/BetterTwitFix)).
-   Get structured alerts with rich Discord Components.
-   Fine-tune alerts using filters like keywords or media-only.
-   Deploy effortlessly with Docker or run locally with Python.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start: Docker Compose

Rename `config.example.toml` to `config.toml` and set your instance configuration(s).

Next, edit and run this example `compose.yaml` with `docker compose up`.

```yaml
services:
    bluebird:
        container_name: bluebird
        image: ethanchrisp/bluebird:latest
        environment:
            LOG_LEVEL: INFO
            LOG_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL: https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YYYYYYYY/YYYYYYYY
            LOG_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_LEVEL: WARNING
        volumes:
            - /local/path/to/config.toml:/bluebird/config.toml:ro
        restart: unless-stopped
```

### Standalone: Python

> [!NOTE]
> Python 3.13 or later required.

1. Install dependencies.

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment.

3. Rename `config.example.toml` to `config.toml` and set your instance configuration(s).

4. Run Bluebird

    ```bash
    uv run bluebird.py
    ```

### Configuration

Each instance within `config.toml` can be configured to filter posts from sending notifications.
